        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Our journey began in March 2021, born from a vision to create a space that wasn't just a restaurant, but a
            celebration of brunch culture. Located in the vibrant McGregor Square, adjacent to the bustling energy of
            Coors Field, Riviera has quickly become a cornerstone of Denver's dining scene.

            Originally conceptualized as a 1950's diner, we embraced the nostalgic charm of the era, serving up classic
            lunches and dinners alongside weekend brunches. While we cherished our roots, we soon realized the true
            calling of our establishment lay in the unique allure of brunch - a meal that symbolizes relaxation,
            indulgence, and togetherness.

            We embraced this calling wholeheartedly and transformed Riviera into a brunch-only destination. This bold
            move was driven by a passion to innovate and a desire to serve our community better. The change was more
            than just altering our menu; it was about aligning with the heart and soul of our space, our people, and the
            vibrant energy of Denver.

            Today, Riviera stands as a testament to culinary creativity and communal spirit. Brunch is not just a meal
            and we are not just a restaurant; we are a gathering place for friends, families, and food lovers. Our
            kitchen is a playground of flavors, where classic meets contemporary, and every dish tells a story.

            Join us at Riviera, where every brunch is an experience, every dish is a delight, and every guest is family.
            This is our story, a story of passion, innovation, and community. This is the original - Riviera of brunch
            in New York.</p>

            through the restaurant to an outdoor patio located within McGregor Square for a front row seat to the
            bustling plaza and expansive outdoor screen.

            Whether you're looking to kick-start your day, unwind on the weekends, or simply relish the joys of a
            leisurely brunch, Riviera is your ultimate destination. Join us in celebrating the art of brunch, where
